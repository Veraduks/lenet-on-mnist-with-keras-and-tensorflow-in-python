# LeNet on MNIST with Keras and Tensorflow in Python

This is an open-source implementation of LeNet convolutional deep neural network.

It is trained to detect handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. 

It is written in Python and uses Keras on top of Tensorflow.

The model correctly recognizes handwritten digits with approximately 98% accuracy.
